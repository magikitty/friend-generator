# Friend Generator

## Overview

I created this program as a hobby project to practice working with API endpoints and JSON data. The project is written in Go and the data is stored in JSON format.

This program generates "friends" for the user and stores their data in a JSON file. This project uses the [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) open-source API.
